# GOT-Death-Prediction---Classification-Model-Development-
In this work, I came across a dataset that includes all the information about the characters in the popular TV show- Game of Thrones. 
The goal is to create predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable). 
This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development. 
I have developed Logistic Regression, GBM, KNN, Decision Trees & Random Forest models for this project. Out of which I chose the best model to be the one with the highest AUC score.
